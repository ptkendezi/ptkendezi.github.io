<h4>My Background</h4>
Often I get asked what my nationality is when people take a first glance at my name. It's an interesting question that I've found a lot of pride in answering. My name is the Albanian word for sparrow, which was chosen by my father who was born and lived in Albania for his early part of his life. I'm a peculiar mix of very different cultures, which has shaped me to be a person of cultural diversity. My father came to America as a refugee in the late 1970s to escape from the oppressive communist regime that was in control of the small Eastern-European country at the time. My mother immmigrated to America from Colombia in the early 1980s, and ended up meeting my father in the melting pot that is New York. I'm proud to be a mixture of my father's Eastern-European background with my mother's Latin-American background. I learned to speak Spanish before I learned to speak English, and frequently traveled across South America and Europe as a child. <p>
<h4>Growing Up</h4>

I was born in the lower east side of New York City in 1996 and lived there until I was about to start Kindergarten in 2001, when my father completed construction on our estate in Westchester, the suburbs just north of the city. Growing up I was always on the go since we lived between our weekend apartment in New York and our home in Westchester, which allowed me to enter into the highly ranked Katonah-Lewisboro public school system. I was both enamored by the beauty of the pastoral and suburban life in Westchester and the fast paced excitement of the city.<br>
In 2010 I started high school at John Jay High School and found my place in the competitive academic environment that it was. I took advantage of every honors and AP class that was offered, and graduated in the top 10% of the class of 2014. While at John Jay, I was actively involved in extracurricular activities and would volunteer often at many non-profit organizations across the area (see <a href="experience.html">experience</a> to learn more). Being a student at John Jay was an incredible experience because it allowed me to dabble in many different categories of academia--I took classes in business, videography, photography, architecture, and even webpage design.<p>
<h4>Interests & Hobbies </h4>
As a child I found an interest in the arts and often visited many museums across the New York metro area that inspired in me a passion for the humanities. I would read often and enjoyed literature from Ancient Greek poetry to modern crime novels. In high school I found a passion for Southern Gothic literature, particularly that of William Faulkner, who inspired me to write. I found a strong liking for William Shakespeare and if asked to chose my favorite work of literature, I would chose Macbeth. I am particularly fond of writing poetry, but also enjoy writing short novellas in the spirit of Southern Gothic literature.<br>
I enjoy photography very much and gained experience in videography while taking a Digital Moviemaking & Animation course my sophomore year of High School. My short narrative and my stop motion videos were even chosen to be screened at the Film Festival at Caramoor Center for the Arts.<br>
I've always had an interest in traveling and love immersing myself in different cultures. I would consider myself a worldly person and have traveled to many places across the globe. One of my favorite spots I visited was in 2006 when my family and I visited Acapulco, Mexico. The culture was rich with ancient history mixed with modern touches. Driving through the landscape we saw ancient pyramids, pristine beaches, and tall rocky cliffs that experienced divers would dive into the ocean from. I continue to find a passion in adventure and experiencing all that life has to offer and often I'm one to say there isn't any place or experience that I would dare to turn down!
